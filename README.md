A Molecular Orbital Analysis of Intrinsic Point Defects in MgO

I worked on this project while completing my Masters in Materials Science at Northwestern University between September 2021 and December 2022.

Special thanks to Michael Toriyama and Professor Jeff Snyder of Northwestern University for their guidance on the project.

All DFT calculations were completed using Vasp (Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package) https://www.vasp.at/ on Northwestern's Quest High-Performance Computing Cluster
